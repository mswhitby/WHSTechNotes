The Benefits and Risks of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries like healthcare, education, and business, but it also comes with challenges. In this journal entry, write about how AI has the potential to help improve our lives. Then, consider some ways in which AI could cause harm, especially in areas like privacy, jobs, and security. Be sure to support your thoughts with examples for both sides.

- Helpful: How does AI improve efficiency and innovation in industries like healthcare, education, or transportation?
- Harmful: What are some risks AI poses, such as job automation, bias in algorithms, or cybersecurity threats?

Write two paragraphs—one focusing on the benefits and one on the potential risks.

Last week we looked at computer science jobs. This week we'll look at applying computer science to jobs in any industry. I'd like you to consider why is learning to code valuable regardless of the industry you choose to work in?

Write a paragraph or more focused on the following:

1. How can coding improve problem-solving skills?
2. How might understanding code help you in industries that aren’t directly related to technology, such as healthcare, finance, or education?
3. How does coding enhance creativity or collaboration?

Provide examples where coding knowledge might benefit professionals in various fields. Remember to use specific examples and reflect on how coding can impact your future career path, even if it’s not directly related to computer science.

Think about your daily routine and activities. Identify one task or process where computer science plays a role, either directly or indirectly. Write a paragraph describing how computer science is used and how it impacts your life. Consider things like apps you use, websites you visit, or even the technology behind devices you rely on. How would your day be different without this use of computer science?

## Periods 1, 5, 6, 7, & Practicum

In your digital GitHub journal, write a paragraph explaining why following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code?

In your response, consider the following:

- How does precision affect the outcome of a program?
- What can happen if steps or details are missed in coding?
- Why is it important to develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey?

Remember to use Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning (C.E.R.) to structure your response.

## Periods 3 & 4

This week, we began learning Python programming. In your journal, write a paragraph comparing the experience of using Sphero block coding to writing Python code. Consider the following:

1. **Ease of Use:** Which did you find easier to understand and why?
2. **Problem-Solving:** How did the two approaches help you solve coding challenges?
3. **Flexibility:** In which environment did you feel you had more control or creative freedom?
4. **Real-World Application:** How do you think Python programming might be more useful or versatile compared to block coding in Sphero?

Be sure to give specific examples from your experiences with both platforms.

_Reflecting on Our GitHub Journal Process_

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Let’s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

- **For Me:** What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
- **For You:** Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?

Please share your thoughts, as we’ll use this feedback to make sure everyone’s journals are properly set up moving forward.

## Periods 1, 3, 4, & 6 - Sphero BOLT
1. List 3 sensors found on the Sphero BOLT
2. Choose one of the sensors, and write a paragraph explaining how that sensor functions.

> Note: In your paragraph, describe how the sensor you chose works and how it helps the Sphero BOLT operate. Does it measure light, speed, direction, or something else? Provide details about how the sensor gathers data and how the robot uses that information to move or react to its surroundings. Try to give an example of how this sensor might be used in a specific activity or challenge.

## 5th Period - Game Programming
Think about a video game that you enjoy playing. In a paragraph or more, describe the aspects of that game that make it enjoyable or successful. 

> Note: Consider elements like gameplay mechanics, graphics, storyline, music, and character design. Why do you think these aspects work well together, and how do they contribute to the overall experience of the game? Be as specific as possible in your analysis.

## 5th Period - App Development
Think about a mobile or web application that you use frequently. In a paragraph or more, describe the features of the app that make it useful or enjoyable to use. 

> Note: Consider elements such as the user interface (UI), design, ease of use, functionality, performance, and any unique features that set it apart. How do these aspects work together to provide a good user experience? Be specific in your analysis, and think about how these ideas could inform your own app development projects.

## 7th Period, Practicum, Independent Study and other Python Students
In a paragraph or more, reflect on your experience learning Python so far. What do you find most interesting or challenging about the language? 

> Note: Think about the basic concepts you’ve learned, such as variables, data types, or loops. How do you think these fundamentals will help you as you continue to learn more advanced programming concepts? Provide specific examples from your experience to explain your thoughts.
