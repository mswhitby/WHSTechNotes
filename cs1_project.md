# Computer Science 1 - Coding Project

If a you have a project idea not mentioned in the examples, you can still follow the same weekly structure but adapt it to your project.

## Week 1: Project Proposal and Setup
**Tasks:**
- Write a project proposal explaining your idea, key features, and the Python concepts you’ll use (variables, loops, lists, dictionaries, functions).
- Set up the initial environment, write the first lines of code, and outline the project’s basic structure.

## Week 2: Basic Functionality
**Tasks:**
- Implement the core mechanics of your idea (e.g., for a simulation, get basic movement; for a chatbot, set up basic conversation flow).
- Incorporate input/output interactions or simple logic that aligns with their project.

## Week 3: Intermediate Features and Complexity
**Tasks:**
- Add more functionality, such as implementing loops for repeated actions or interactions, or more complex decision-making based on user input.
- Ensure the project works through simple scenarios.

## Week 4: Modularization and Functions
 **Tasks:**
- Break the project into functions to manage the code more easily. Each function should have a clear purpose that fits their project idea (e.g., generating random outcomes, processing user input).
- Ensure the project is organized and user-friendly.

## Week 5: Advanced Features and Testing
**Tasks:**
- Add any advanced features based on their idea (e.g., improving algorithms, creating a scoring system, adding data visualization).
- Test the project thoroughly and fix any issues.

## Week 6: Final Touches and Submission
**Tasks:**
- Finish polishing the project, add comments and explanations in the code, and write up a README explaining how to use the project and what it does.
